🔧 Test Directory Setup:
bash
# Create comprehensive test directory
mkdir ls_test
cd ls_test

# Create various file types
touch normal.txt
mkdir directory
ln -s normal.txt symlink.txt
chmod +x normal.txt  # make it executable
touch .hidden.txt
mkdir .hidden_dir

# Cleanup function
cleanup() {
    cd ..
    rm -rf ls_test
}
🚨 Specific Crash Scenarios:
Case 36: Directory deleted during listing
bash
mkdir temp_dir
touch temp_dir/file{1..10}.txt
# Simulate concurrent deletion while listing
ls -l temp_dir & rm -rf temp_dir
Expected: Should handle gracefully

Case 37: File becomes directory during stat
bash
touch changing_file
# During ls -l, replace file with directory
ls -l changing_file & rm changing_file && mkdir changing_file
Expected: Should handle file type changes

Case 38: Very long path names
bash
LONG_PATH=$(printf "dir%.0s" {1..50})
mkdir -p "$LONG_PATH"
ls "$LONG_PATH"
Expected: No path length issues

Case 39: Mixed valid and invalid arguments
bash
mkdir valid_dir
ls valid_dir /nonexistent valid_dir
Expected: Should process valid args and error on invalid ones

Case 40: Options as arguments
bash
touch -l -a -F
ls -- -l -a -F
Expected: Should list files named -l, -a, -F

Make sure your ls implementation:

Validates all directory paths before accessing

Handles opendir(), readdir(), stat() failures gracefully

Properly manages memory for file lists and strings

Handles all three options and their combinations correctly

Doesn't crash on any file system state

These tests should help identify any panic conditions in your ls implementation with -l, -a, and -F options!

now mkdir no argument
Here are comprehensive test cases for the mkdir command with no options that could potentially panic or break your implementation:

🚨 Dangerous MKDIR Test Cases
💥 Case 1: No arguments
bash
mkdir
Expected: Usage error message (missing operand)

💥 Case 2: Empty argument
bash
mkdir ""
Expected: Should handle empty string gracefully with error

💥 Case 3: Only spaces
bash
mkdir "    "
Expected: Should treat as invalid directory name

💥 Case 4: Directory already exists
bash
mkdir existing_dir
mkdir existing_dir
Expected: Error "File exists" or similar

💥 Case 5: Multiple existing directories
bash
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
Expected: Should error on all existing directories

💥 Case 6: Mixed existing and new directories
bash
mkdir dir1
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3
Expected: Should create new directories, error on existing ones

💥 Case 7: Permission denied
bash
mkdir /root/restricted  # if not root
Expected: Permission error message

💥 Case 8: Non-existent parent directory
bash
mkdir /nonexistent/parent/new_dir
Expected: Error "No such file or directory" for parent path

💥 Case 9: Special characters in directory name
bash
mkdir "dir with spaces"
bash
mkdir "dir*with*stars"
bash
mkdir "dir?with?questions"
Expected: Should create directories with special characters

💥 Case 10: Very long directory name
bash
LONG_NAME=$(printf "a%.0s" {1..500})
mkdir "$LONG_NAME"
Expected: No buffer overflow, should create directory

💥 Case 11: Unicode and emoji in names
bash
mkdir "中文目录"
bash
mkdir "dir with 🚀 emoji"
Expected: Should handle Unicode properly

💥 Case 12: Directory name with slashes
bash
mkdir "dir/with/slash"  # This should fail
Expected: Should reject names with slashes

💥 Case 13: Directory name with null bytes
bash
# Attempt to create dir with null byte
mkdir "dir\0withnull"
Expected: Should handle or reject null bytes

💥 Case 14: Dot and dotdot as names
bash
mkdir "."
mkdir ".."
Expected: Should reject . and .. as directory names

💥 Case 15: Name starting with dash
bash
mkdir "-help"
bash
mkdir "--version"
Expected: Should create directories with dash names

💥 Case 16: Multiple directories creation
bash
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 dir4 dir5
Expected: Should create all directories

💥 Case 17: Too many arguments
bash
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 dir4 dir5 dir6 dir7 dir8 dir9 dir10 dir11 dir12 dir13 dir14 dir15
Expected: Should handle many directory names

💥 Case 18: Symlink in path
bash
mkdir target_dir
ln -s target_dir link_dir
mkdir link_dir/new_dir
Expected: Should create directory in target location

💥 Case 19: Broken symlink in path
bash
ln -s /nonexistent/directory broken_link
mkdir broken_link/new_dir
Expected: Should error on broken symlink

💥 Case 20: Circular symlinks in path
bash
ln -s circle1 circle2
ln -s circle2 circle1
mkdir circle1/new_dir
Expected: Should detect circular reference

💥 Case 21: File with same name exists
bash
touch file_exists
mkdir file_exists
Expected: Error "File exists" (not a directory)

💥 Case 22: Device file with same name
bash
# If possible to create in test environment
mkdir /dev/some_device  # might exist
Expected: Should error appropriately

💥 Case 23: Parent is a file, not directory
bash
touch parent_file
mkdir parent_file/child_dir
